The thoughts, ideas, help, and support of many people
went into making this project. In no particular order
they are:

Noel O'Boyle: I used his cinfony code as the base to
understand how the different projects generate fingerprints.
He also encouraged me to develop these tools and put
them out to the world.

The OpenBabel developers, for developing a widely
used tool in cheminformatics with both hash and
substructure fingerprints.

Greg Landrum, for RDKit and for discussions about
what's needed in a fingerprint format and what can
be left out ... for now. Sparse and count fingerprints
will come!

OpenEye, for a non-commercial license to their tools.

To you, for reading this list and using the code.
